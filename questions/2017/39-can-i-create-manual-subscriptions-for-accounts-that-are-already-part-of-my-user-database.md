Yes, you would simply need to know their WP User ID#. When viewing your list of Subscribers at **WordPress Dashboard → Comment Mail → Subscriptions**, at the top click **Add New**.

This will take you to the "New Subscription" page to fill out the necessary details for the manual subscription.

This allows you to manually create new subscriptions for existing users.
