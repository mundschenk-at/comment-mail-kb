Yes, subscribers can modify and manage their existing subscription by accessing their **My Comment Subscription** Page via the link found at the bottom of the page whenever subscribing to a comment. Subscribers can also find this link in the footer of any notification emails they receive.

From the My Comment Subscriptions page, they can then customize their subscriptions from a number of different options such as: the email used for receiving updates for the Subscription, displayed Name, the specific Post they wish to subscribe to, specific Comments / Comment Threads / Replies or even All Comments / Replies, and even how often they receive notifications for updates.
