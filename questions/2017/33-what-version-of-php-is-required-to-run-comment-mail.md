Comment Mail requires a minimum of PHP 5.4+ to install and run. 

Comment Mail is also compatible with **PHP v7.0**, you must be running PHP v7.0.9+. Starting with Comment Mail v161118, if you're running **PHP v7 < 7.0.9** a warning is displayed in the WordPress Dashboard asking the site owner to upgrade to **PHP v7.0.9** or higher. Note: While **PHP v7.0.9** is adequate, **PHP v7.0.10** is strongly recommended.
