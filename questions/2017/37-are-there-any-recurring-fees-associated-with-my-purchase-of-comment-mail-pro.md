No. All versions of Comment Mail Pro are sold with a one-time charge; no recurring fees.

**Lifetime Updates + 12 Months of Support**

A purchase of Comment Mail Pro comes with lifetime plugin updates and access to 12 months (1 year) of support. After 12 months, you may choose to renew your access to support, or not. Renewals do not occur automatically. If you do choose to renew (i.e., you need ongoing access to support) the rate is just $5/year for a Single-Site license, and $10/year for the Unlimited-Site license.
