Yes, you may download Comment Mail Lite from WordPress.org - [Comment Mail Lite](https://wordpress.org/plugins/comment-mail/) and preview Comment Mail Pro's features.

If you are undecided on if you want to upgrade to Pro or not, it is possible to 'Preview Pro Features' via Comment Mail Lite by clicking the corresponding header link. Comment Mail Pro has numerous useful features not available in Comment Mail Lite that will enhance your Subscriptions and over-all user experience.
