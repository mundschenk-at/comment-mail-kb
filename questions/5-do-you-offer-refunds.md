## Do you offer refunds?

Yes. Comment Mail comes with a 30 day Money Back Guarantee. In other words, this guarantee lasts 30 days, which lets you explore all features of the Pro Version, risk-free.

Due to the nature of this product, we strongly suggest you try the Comment Mail Lite Version plugin first (It's free!) and review the [Features](http://comment-mail.com/features/) page to understand how the PRO version will benefit your work!

We will refund your money within 30 days from the date of purchase:
* If Comment Mail Pro does not process comment subscriptions
* If you have an issue with Comment Mail Pro that we cannot resolve
* If we are unable to resolve a technical issue related to the main feature (i.e., comment subscriptions)

We will not provide refunds for technical issues unless you have first allowed us to attempt to resolve the issue. 

To receive a refund, please [open a support ticket](https://www.websharks-inc.com/support/?product=comment-mail&request_type=trouble_ticket) and send us with the *log files* to demonstrate that Comment Mail Pro failed to process comment subscriptions for you. All refunds require an existing support ticket as evidence that you have given us the opportunity to resolve the issue. 

Refunds do not apply to any renewal fees for continued access to support.

Purchasing Comment Mail Pro indicates that you agree to the terms of the [Refund Policy] (http://comment-mail.com/snippet/refund-policy/).
